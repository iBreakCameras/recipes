<h1>Citrus Pear Meal Instructions</h1>
<h4>Just a few tips for storage and cooking</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Store the meals upright so they can easily be transferred to your
crockpot. Place a cutting board, cookie sheet or piece of cardboard
under them to prevent them from freezing to the rack/shelf.</li>
    <li>When you are ready to cook a meal, simply rip the bag off and drop
it right into the crock pot! Some people like to run them under warm
water for 1-2 minutes to get the bag off more easily.</li>
    <li>Keep in mind that all crock pots cook differently so if you know
yours cooks hotter, set it for the lower range of recommended time.</li>

<div id="disclaimerUSDA">*The USDA does not recommend cooking frozen meat in the slow cooker. It is recommended to place your meal in the fridge the night before or defrost in the microwave to promote even, safe cooking.*</div>
